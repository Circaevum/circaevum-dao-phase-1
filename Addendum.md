### Section 7(b): Notice of Restrictions on Duties and Transfers

This supplemental answer is submitted in view of the following statement taken verbatim from the Wyoming Statutes section 17-31-104, which is required to appear conspicuously in the Articles of Organization or the operating agreement, as per W.S. 17-31-104(c):

> "The rights of members in a decentralized autonomous organization may differ materially from the rights of members in other limited liability companies. The Wyoming Decentralized Autonomous Organization Supplement, underlying smart contracts, articles of organization and operating agreement, if applicable, of a decentralized autonomous organization may define, reduce or eliminate fiduciary duties and may restrict transfer of ownership interests, withdrawal or resignation from the decentralized autonomous organization, return of capital contributions and dissolution of the decentralized autonomous organization."

In view of the above statement, the following are checked with an "X" as appropriate:

  - Duties are subject to quarterly review and assessment

- [X] Transfer of ownership interests in this DAO LLC is restricted in the following ways, if any:
  - YANG tokens have restricted transferability and require governance approval for transfers
  - Taiji Point token is non-transferable except through formal governance procedures
  - YIN tokens are freely transferable within the ecosystem

- [X] Withdrawal or resignation from this DAO LLC is restricted in the following ways, if any:
  - Withdrawal follows the quarterly assessment cycle
  - Inactive members are subject to token decay mechanics as specified in the operating agreement

- [X] Return of capital contributions in this DAO LLC is restricted in the following ways, if any:
  - Capital distributions follow the quarterly profit distribution mechanism
  - Profit allocation is determined by token ownership and phase of development

- [X] Dissolution of this DAO LLC is restricted in the following ways, if any:
  - Dissolution requires supermajority vote of both YANG and YIN token holders
  - Dissolution process must follow the established governance procedures

### Section 8(b): Optional Information Related to W.S. 17-31-106(c)

#### (i) Relations among the members and between the members and the decentralized autonomous organization:

The Circaevum DAO operates on a Taiji-inspired governance model, emphasizing balance and cyclical progression.

- **Quarterly Cycles**: Every quarter, the DAO evaluates contributions, scopes future work, conducts votes, distributes revenue, and adjusts equity.
- All members shall interact on a basis of mutual respect, transparency, and shared purpose.
- The DAO is recognized as an independent legal entity. Interactions between individual members and the DAO are subject to the terms of this Addendum and the operating agreement.
- Disputes shall be resolved through the established DAO dispute resolution process.

**Yin-Yang Dynamics**:

- **Yin (Adaptive)**: Encourages emergent, creative contributions that foster innovation.
  - The YIN token (`8J2Xt2G3US2yWTwDtKxGUwwKCnNzNcoXwEMVPwV6HTzw`) functions as the Community Token. Members can earn 1 YIN for every 1 Story Point they have completed using a typical scrum methodology.
  - YIN tokens represent 0.9% of total allocation, with 13,500 tokens issued.
  - YIN provides profit-sharing rights but no equity or direct governance.
  
- **Yang (Structured)**: Focuses on structured, goal-oriented tasks ensuring stability and progress.
  - The YANG token (`7E8nSaFbB1LwAKZXUVcH2jBkS9RR5FgzQi3xdHAToShX`) functions as the Council Token. Members can convert 750 YIN tokens for 1 YANG token.
  - YANG tokens represent 2.7% of total allocation, with 18 tokens issued.
  - YANG provides governance rights, equity, and profit-sharing.
  
- **Taiji Point**: The central governing position representing 2.71% of total allocation, with 1 token issued.
  - Provides governance rights, equity, and profit-sharing.
  - Not subject to decay mechanics.

This duality ensures that members engage in both creative and structured activities, promoting a harmonious and dynamic organizational environment.

#### (ii) Rights and duties under this chapter of a person in their capacity as a member:

**Rights**:

- Participate in governance decisions through proposal submission and voting, as determined by token ownership.
- Access and review DAO operational records and audits.
- Receive profit distributions according to token holdings and the quarterly distribution mechanism.

**Growth Progression and Voting Rights**:

**Round One: Outer Core - First 6 team members (CEO is Inner Core)**
- Inner Core (Taiji Point): 16% voting power
- Outer Core (6 members): 14% voting power each, can earn up to 5.4% equity (two YANG tokens)

**Round Two: Mantle - Next 12 team members**
- Inner Core: 10% voting power
- Outer Core: 7% voting power each
- Mantle: 4% voting power each, can earn up to 2.7% equity (one YANG token)

**Round Three: Biosphere - Next 18 team members**
- Inner Core: 2.71% voting power
- Outer Core: 2.7% voting power each
- Mantle: 2.7% voting power each
- Biosphere: 2.7% voting power each, can earn up to 1.8% equity (through YIN tokens)

**Duties**:

- Act in good faith to promote the DAO's mission.
- Contribute to discussions and vote on proposals in a timely manner.
- Safeguard personal digital credentials and maintain security best practices.

**Contribution Assessment**: Members' contributions are evaluated quarterly, influencing their equity and voting power.

**Equity Dynamics**: Equity is fluid, adjusting based on the nature and impact of contributions, ensuring alignment with the DAO's evolving goals.


#### (iii) Activities of the decentralized autonomous organization and the conduct of those activities:

The DAO's activities will center on the development, funding, and community oversight of the Circaevum project, a 3D graphics engine for Time designed to aggregate, index, visualize, and navigate TimeStamps across datasets.

- All actions and proposals must adhere to the DAO's mission statement and be executed under transparent protocols.
- Regular reporting and periodic audits shall be conducted to ensure accountability.

The DAO's activities are structured around quarterly cycles, each encompassing:

1. **Treasury Management**: All Revenue enters the Treasury, and payments to Costs for the Quarter are deployed.
2. **Contribution Tally**: Reviewing and assessing member inputs from the previous quarter.
3. **Future Planning**: YANG token holders vote on the next Quarter's needs, and estimated costs are set aside from Profits.
4. **Profit Distribution - Part 1**: 1st half of remaining Profits is set aside for YIN token holders.
5. **Profit Distribution - Part 2**: 2nd half of profits is divided amongst YANG holders, then is voted on for future investments.
6. **Cycle Progression**: The YinYang rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise, and the next Quarter begins.

This cyclical approach ensures continuous alignment with the DAO's mission and market dynamics.

#### (iv) Means and conditions for amending the operating agreement:

- Any member may propose an amendment by submitting a formal proposal.
- Proposals must be published with at least 30 days' notice to all members.
- Amendments require a supermajority vote (e.g., 67% of voting interests) to pass.
- Voting power is distributed according to the current growth phase as outlined in section (ii).

#### (v) Rights and voting rights of members:

- Members' voting rights are determined by their token holdings and the current growth phase of the DAO.
- Voting power transitions through three distinct phases (Outer Core, Mantle, Biosphere) as detailed in section (ii).
- In the final phase, voting power equalizes with the Inner Core having 2.71% and all other positions having 2.7%.
- A quorum for any vote shall be defined as a majority of the membership interests entitled to vote.

#### (vi) Transferability of membership interests:

- YIN tokens are freely transferable within the ecosystem.
- YANG tokens may be transferred only with prior approval by the DAO through a defined transfer process.
- The Taiji Point token is non-transferable except through formal governance procedures.
- All transfers must comply with applicable laws and be recorded on the DAO's official ledger.
- The DAO reserves the right to impose reasonable conditions on such transfers to protect community integrity.

#### (vii) Withdrawal of membership:

- A member may withdraw by providing written notice to the DAO.
- The withdrawal process will include reconciliation of any outstanding obligations and a review of digital asset contributions.
- Tokens subject to decay mechanics may be reduced if the member has been inactive.
- Upon withdrawal, the member forfeits future voting and distribution rights while maintaining any rights accrued prior to withdrawal.

#### (viii) Distributions to members prior to dissolution:

- Distributions follow the quarterly review process outlined in section (iii).
- YIN token holders receive a share of the first half of profits.
- YANG token holders receive a share of the second half of profits and vote on reinvestment.
- Distribution decisions must ensure the long-term financial stability of the DAO by maintaining an appropriate reserve fund.
- Distribution proposals shall follow the same notice and voting requirements as other major decisions.

#### (ix) Amendment of the articles of organization:

- Amendments to the Articles of Organization must be proposed by a member or group of members and follow the established amendment procedure outlined in Section 4 above.
- All changes must be in full compliance with applicable Wyoming statutes and the DAO's core mission.
- Voting on amendments follows the power distribution of the current growth phase.

#### (x) Procedures for amending, updating, editing or changing applicable smart contracts:

- Any proposed change to the DAO's smart contracts must be submitted as a detailed proposal, including a technical white paper outlining risks, benefits, and testing protocols.
- Proposed changes require community review and a supermajority vote (e.g., 67%) after a designated waiting period to ensure sufficient feedback.
- Approved changes shall be implemented following thorough testing on a staging environment prior to deployment on the main network.
- Smart contract changes must be compatible with the Solana blockchain environment.

#### (xi) All other aspects of the decentralized autonomous organization, including but not limited to modifications of the following default provisions in W.S. 17-31-11:

- **Membership Interest Calculation**: Membership interests in this member-managed DAO shall be calculated according to the growth phase model outlined in section (ii), with specific percentages assigned based on position (Inner Core, Outer Core, Mantle, or Biosphere).
- **Voting Rights without Digital Asset Contribution**: In instances where membership does not require a digital asset contribution, each member shall have one (1) membership interest and be entitled to one (1) vote.
- **Quorum Requirement**: A quorum for any decision-making process shall require not less than a majority of membership interests entitled to vote.
- **Decay Mechanics**: YANG tokens are subject to decay if inactive before being fully earned. YIN tokens deplete if inactive. The standard burn rate is 2.7% per quarter, averaged across all 36 tokens for each percentage domain (Governance, Equity, Profit Sharing) separately.
- **Additional Provisions**: Any further governance aspects not expressly covered herein shall be determined by future proposals and votes, in a manner consistent with this operating agreement and applicable law.

### Technical Implementation Note:

The Circaevum DAO is implemented on the Solana Realms platform as a standard Community Token DAO, where YIN functions as the Community Token and YANG functions as the Council Token. While this technical implementation provides the foundation for the governance structure, not all aspects of the governance model described in this document are directly enforced on-chain. Many governance decisions, including token distributions, equity adjustments, and quarterly assessments, will occur through formal quarterly meetings, with the results being reflected in token distributions and meeting notes. The official documentation, including any updates to this governance model, can be found at https://github.com/Circaevum/circaevum-dao-phase-1
