# Addendum to Articles of Organization

## Decentralized Autonomous Organization Limited Liability Company

### Section 6: Smart Contract Identifier

The following is the public identifier of any smart contract directly used to manage, facilitate, or operate the decentralized autonomous organization:

- **Governance Program**: `GovER5Lthms3bLBqWub97yVrMmEogzX7xNjdXpPPCVZw`

This governance contract is executed on the Solana blockchain and can be found on the Reams DAO management platform [here](https://app.realms.today/dao/FDerj19PyQytsD1rL4NGpSeXWT8d7WdRABBxxCEnDj6d/params).

*For example, www.Github.io address, or public key address giving access to verified source code at www.etherscan.io, or W3C DID decentralized identifier, or the like.*

### Section 7(b): Notice of Restrictions on Duties and Transfers

This supplemental answer is submitted in view of the following statement taken verbatim from the Wyoming Statutes section 17-31-104, which is required to appear conspicuously in the Articles of Organization or the operating agreement, as per W.S. 17-31-104(c):

> "The rights of members in a decentralized autonomous organization may differ materially from the rights of members in other limited liability companies. The Wyoming Decentralized Autonomous Organization Supplement, underlying smart contracts, articles of organization and operating agreement, if applicable, of a decentralized autonomous organization may define, reduce or eliminate fiduciary duties and may restrict transfer of ownership interests, withdrawal or resignation from the decentralized autonomous organization, return of capital contributions and dissolution of the decentralized autonomous organization."

In view of the above statement, the following are checked with an "X" as appropriate:

- [X] In this DAO LLC, the rights of members do not differ materially from the rights of members in other limited liability companies.

### Section 8(b): Optional Information Related to W.S. 17-31-106(c)

The complete and current operational details, governance structure, token economics, and all specific mechanisms of the Circaevum DAO are maintained in the official GitHub repository at https://github.com/Circaevum/circaevum-dao-phase-1. This repository constitutes the operating agreement of the DAO and is the authoritative source for all governance information. 

The repository includes comprehensive information about:
- Relations among members
- Rights and duties of members
- Activities of the organization
- Means for amending the operating agreement
- Voting rights
- Token transferability
- Withdrawal procedures
- Distribution mechanisms
- Amendment procedures
- Smart contract update processes
- Other operational aspects

The GitHub repository will only be updated based on a majority decision of governance token holders according to the governance mechanisms described therein.

### Technical Implementation Note:

The Circaevum DAO is implemented on the Solana Realms platform as a standard Community Token DAO. While this technical implementation provides the foundation for the governance structure, not all aspects of the governance model are directly enforced on-chain. Many governance decisions will occur through formal meetings, with the results being reflected in token distributions and meeting notes. The official documentation can be found at https://github.com/Circaevum/circaevum-dao-phase-1.
