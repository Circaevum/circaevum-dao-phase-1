## Vision

General idea here is to visualize the backend as a Memory Palace. Something novel and unique that helps the user actually make sense of WHERE their data is coming from, and HOW it's actually being processed. I want to provide an experience that helps individuals make more sense of their data, not hide it and only show them cherry-picked information. The backend consists of a collection of third-party API data retrievals, many with unique data types, and each of those falls into one of several service categories. To display this information in a novel way, I've decided to model the memory palace roughly after the International Space Station. To not make it too difficult to remember, I'm just gonna call it the Integration Space Station. And just like the real ISS, this one is also designed to be constructed in modules over time. 

## Evolution

- Early concept → Memory Palace → Current ISS breakdown
**Early Concept**
The attempt to create a visual representation of the backend has evolved over several iterations. First was the Server Racks of the Meta Quest version. The idea was simple: a server tower for each file, and a rack on that tower for each unique c# method. Whenever one method called a method or information from another file, it would draw a line between the two, and trace the flow of logic from start to finish of the login process.
**AVP Transitional Approach**
When things migrated to the Apple Vision Pro, lineRenderers amongs other things didn't work, so I just made basic boxes with labels meant to change to Green when that component completed, or Red if it hit an error. It loosely worked, but every now and then would just go full green even though some weren't properly working. Most like due to sharing materials. 


## Current State (25Q3)

A server farm is hard to pack into the base "Platform" of the Windowed App scene on the Apple Vision Pro, so the new approach is to come up with something resembling the International Space Station. This is something that is simple enough of a layout to establish the systems on the Circaevum backend, namely - a central hub (the core Game Server that stores user profiles, and data unique to Circaevum), a control center (saves account config), a left wing (health services), and a right wing (financial services). Each of these are modular apprendages that are constructed using pods. Each pod is based around a particular API's unique data type. If it's a Google Calendar API Pod, then it includes the VEVENT object shape from the official iCalendar spec, as well as the other parameters needed to make that request (user ID, current refresh token, relative timeframe, etc.). It also shows metadata on the responses from the request, which could be a list of events, or an error message. All contained in that pod so it's easy to troubleshoot on-device when data isn't coming in.
