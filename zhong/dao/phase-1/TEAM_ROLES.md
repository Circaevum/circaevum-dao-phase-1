## Team Rules

### GitHub Commit Rule
**Rule**: Each new version of any component must be committed to GitHub with a screenshot of what is unique to this version.

**Implementation**:
- Every feature completion requires a GitHub commit
- Each commit must include a screenshot showing the unique aspects of that version
- Screenshots should be placed in the `/screenshots/` directory
- Commit messages should clearly describe the version's unique features
- Screenshots must demonstrate the specific functionality added or changed

**Example Commit Structure**:
```
commit: "Add 3D timestamp visualization component v1.2"
- /screenshots/timestamp-viz-v1.2.png
- /frontend/components/TimestampViz.js
- /docs/timestamp-viz-spec.md
```

**Benefits**:
- Provides visual documentation of development progress
- Creates a visual timeline of feature evolution
- Helps team members understand what each version accomplishes
- Serves as a portfolio of work completed
- Enables easy rollback to previous versions if needed
