**Abstract**:
Circaevum is a 3D graphics engine for Time - a system to aggregate, index, visualize, and navigate TimeStamps across datasets. Each dot in our Yin-Yang model represents an ongoing problem that needs solving, whether it's Front-End (Yang) or Back-End (Yin) focused.

On a Quarterly basis, we:
- Tally contributions towards solving these problems
- Scope future work and vote on priorities
- Distribute revenue and adjust equity
- Rotate focus to the next set of problems

This Yin-Yang inspired model is designed to:
- Provide a framework to simplify and streamline problem-solving
- Incentivize long-term contributions
- Keep the company lean and balanced
- Provide an intuitive model for equity distribution
- Serve as a flywheel for innovation and growth
- Be visualized using Circaevum, naturally

The Circaevum DAO is a Realms' Community Token DAO on the Solana blockchain, and can be found here: https://app.realms.today/dao/FDerj19PyQytsD1rL4NGpSeXWT8d7WdRABBxxCEnDj6d

**Problem Tracking System**:
This README uses a precise problem tracking system that links directly to commit history:
1. **Problem IDs**: Each problem has a unique ID (e.g., PROBLEM-YIN-001)
2. **Commit Links**: Completed problems link directly to specific commits
3. **Token Awards**: Clear token assignment tied to problem completion
4. **Version Tracking**: Version numbers include problem IDs for traceability

**Quarterly Reconciliation Process**:
This README and the TimeBox CHANGELOG.md are reconciled quarterly to ensure:
1. **Problem Status Alignment**: Current problems reflect actual development progress
2. **Version Synchronization**: TimeBox version numbers align with quarterly cycles
3. **Achievement Documentation**: Completed problems are properly documented and celebrated
4. **Future Planning**: Next quarter's problems are scoped based on current progress

### Yin-Yang Characteristics

**Yin (Back-End)**: Adaptive, foundational, source of data emergence
- Each YIN token represents a solved backend problem
- YIN tokens have governance rights, equity, and profit-sharing (balanced with YANG)
- YIN tokens require active participation to maintain their full value (balanced with YANG)
- YIN tokens can be converted to YANG tokens when backend systems are ready to support frontend features

**Yang (Front-End)**: Active, full of light and density, carries the user interface and experience momentum
- Each YANG token represents a solved frontend problem
- YANG tokens have governance rights, equity, and profit-sharing (balanced with YIN)
- YANG tokens require active participation to maintain their full value (balanced with YIN)

**Zhong (中)**: The Center Contract - The transition mechanism between Front-End and Back-End
- Represents the current work being done each quarter
- Focuses on 6 main problems (3 Front-End + 3 Back-End) that work together
- Serves as the central hub where data flows between frontend and backend
- The central coordination point (formerly "Space Station Memory Palace")

**Wu Wei (无为)**: Represents investors who provide capital but not direct labor contributions
- Balances against active contributors (YIN/YANG)
- Participates in governance decisions and receives profit-sharing (annual distributions)
- Each Wu Wei token represents an investment milestone (e.g., $50k, $100k, $250k)
- Long-term focus: Annual profit distributions (vs quarterly for active contributors)

### Quarterly Problem-Solving Cycle

1. **Revenue & Costs**: All revenue enters Treasury, costs are paid, profits set aside
2. **Contribution Tally**: Previous quarter's problem-solving contributions are measured
3. **Problem Voting**: YIN and YANG token holders vote on next quarter's 6 main problems to solve
4. **Profit Distribution**: 
   - **Quarterly**: Distributed equally to YIN and YANG token holders (balanced)
   - **Annual**: Accumulated profits distributed to Wu Wei holders (long-term investors)
5. **Future Investment**: YIN and YANG holders vote on company investments
6. **Rotation**: Yin-Yang rotates 90° counterclockwise, shifting to next set of problems
7. **New Quarter**: Begins with new Front-End and Back-End problems flowing through Zhong (中)

### Quarterly Reconciliation Process

**Q1 2025 Reconciliation** (March 2025):
- ✅ **Completed**: Zhong (中) architecture - The Center Contract (Zhong token earned)
- ✅ **Completed**: Nakama device authentication system (YIN token earned)
- ✅ **Completed**: Google Calendar integration (YIN token earned)
- ✅ **Completed**: Sleep data visualization (YIN token earned)
- 🔄 **In Progress**: Mobile optimization (YIN token in progress)
- 📋 **Next Quarter**: ISS Data Pod visualization (YANG token target)

**Reconciliation Checklist** (Every Quarter):
- [ ] Review TimeBox CHANGELOG.md for completed features
- [ ] Update README.md current problems section
- [ ] Award YIN/YANG tokens for completed problems
- [ ] Scope next quarter's problems based on development velocity
- [ ] Update version numbers to align with quarterly cycles
- [ ] Document achievements and lessons learned
- [ ] Vote on next quarter's priorities

### Contributor's Perspective

Upon solving a major backend problem (earning 1 YIN token), the contributor can convert this to 1 YANG token (representing frontend problem-solving leadership). Each token represents a solved problem that contributes to the overall system.

**Development Cycle**: Each quarter focuses on 6 main problems (3 Front-End + 3 Back-End) that work together through **Zhong (中)** - The Center Contract. This creates natural progression where backend solutions support frontend features, and frontend user feedback drives backend improvements.

---

### Mathematical Harmony

The token structure creates perfect balance aligned with Taiji principles:
- 18 YANG tokens (Front-End problems) = 18 major frontend solutions
- 18 YIN tokens (Back-End problems) = 18 major backend solutions  
- 18 Wu Wei tokens (investment milestones) = 18 investment thresholds (e.g., $50k, $100k, $250k)
- 1 Zhong (中) token (central coordination) = 1 CEO/central contract role

**Total: 37 components of value**

With 6 main problems per quarter (3 Front-End + 3 Back-End), you have exactly 6 quarters to address all 36 desired solutions (18 YANG + 18 YIN tokens). This creates a 1.5-year problem-solving cycle where all major frontend and backend challenges are addressed through **Zhong (中)** - The Center Contract.

**Wu Wei Investment Structure**: Each Wu Wei token represents an investment milestone. Investors receive annual profit distributions (long-term focus) vs quarterly distributions for active contributors (YIN/YANG). See [WU_WEI_INVESTMENT_STRUCTURE.md](./WU_WEI_INVESTMENT_STRUCTURE.md) for details.
