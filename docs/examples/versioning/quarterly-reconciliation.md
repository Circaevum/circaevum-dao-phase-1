# Quarterly Reconciliation Process

This document outlines the quarterly reconciliation process between the Circaevum DAO README.md and TimeBox CHANGELOG.md to ensure they remain compatible and aligned.

## Process Overview

Every quarter, the following reconciliation steps must be completed:

1. **Review Development Progress** - Analyze TimeBox CHANGELOG.md for completed features
2. **Update Problem Status** - Mark completed problems and award tokens
3. **Scope Next Quarter** - Define new problems based on development velocity
4. **Update Documentation** - Synchronize README.md and CHANGELOG.md
5. **Version Alignment** - Ensure version numbers align with quarterly cycles

## Token Award Guidelines

### YIN Tokens (Backend Problems)
- Awarded for completed backend infrastructure and systems
- Examples: Authentication systems, data processing, API integrations
- Can be converted to YANG tokens when backend supports frontend features

### YANG Tokens (Frontend Problems)
- Awarded for completed user-facing features and interfaces
- Examples: UI components, user flows, visualization systems
- Require active participation to maintain full value

### Token Conversion Process
- 1 YIN token = 1 YANG token (when backend supports frontend)
- Conversion requires governance approval
- Tokens represent solved problems that contribute to overall system

## Version Number Alignment

### Quarterly Version Scheme
- Q1: v0.4.07-v0.4.09
- Q2: v0.4.10-v0.4.12
- Q3: v0.4.13-v0.4.15
- Q4: v0.4.16-v0.4.18

### Major Version Updates
- Major version updates (v0.5.0, v1.0.0) align with significant milestones
- Coordinate with DAO governance for major version decisions
- Document major version rationale in both README.md and CHANGELOG.md

## Automation Scripts

### Future Automation Ideas
- GitHub Actions workflow for quarterly reconciliation reminders
- Automated token tracking system
- Version number validation scripts
- Problem completion detection based on commit patterns

### Manual Process (Current)
1. Review CHANGELOG.md entries since last reconciliation
2. Map completed features to DAO problems
3. Update README.md current problems section
4. Update CHANGELOG.md quarterly reconciliation summary
5. Update version entries with DAO problem progress
6. Update reconciliation dates
7. Commit changes with reconciliation summary

## Contact and Governance

### Reconciliation Responsibility
- **Primary**: DAO governance token holders
- **Secondary**: Development team leads
- **Review**: All DAO members

### Governance Approval
- Major changes require majority vote of YANG token holders
- Minor updates can be made by development team leads
- All changes must be documented in this reconciliation process
