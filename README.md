# circaevum-dao-phase-1
The Yin Yang Inspired Smart Contract for Phase 1 of Circaevum's DAO Governance - to be launched on February 28, 2025 - on the Grand Planetary Parade where all 7 planets will appear in a line in the sky.

![4o Yin-Yang Art](./images/4o-yin-yang-art.png)

üìå **Abstract**:
On a Quarterly basis, contributions towards the evolution of Circaevum will be tallied, future work will be scoped, votes will take place, and revenue will be dispersed.

This Yin-Yang inspired model is designed to:
- Provide a framework to simplify and streamline this process
- Incentivize long-term contributions
- Keep the company lean and balanced
- Provide an intuitive model for equity ownership
- Create a valuation method for Phase 1 as a DAO
- Be visualized using Circaevum, naturally

### Yin-Yang Characteristics
**Yin**: Adaptive, darkness, source of emergence
- Yin represents the individual. Their contributions are tracked, and can earn them 1 Yin token per quarter.
- This takes up half of a Yin Yang, with a small hole where Yin coagulates into a ball of Yang, which is independent of the other half of the Yin Yang, which also includes a hole

**Yang**: Conservative, resistant to change, source of decay, full of light and density
- Yang represents the company. The overall company is a ball of energy with inertia, and it needs to shed effectively 1 Yang token per quarter to offer incentive to Yin pool.
- The hole in Yang is to represent the portion of Yang that is lost to make way for the proportional incoming Yang.

**Dark Matter**: Exists primarily for investment purposes. Investors can purchase voting rights and equity, but waive profit-sharing (to realize their long-term interest in the company).

### Yin-Yang Geometry
- In a standard Yin Yang model when examined along a line that bisects the center and each of the smaller circles, there are 6 equal segments of equal length in progression: White, Black, White, and then Black, White, Black. The single Black within the first half represents the diameter of the inner black circle (the Yin [black] within the surrounding Yang [white]). The single White within the second half represents the diameter of the inner white circle (the Yang [white] within the surrounding Yin [black]).
- Using this geometry, we can assume that if the radius of an inner circle is 1 (¬Ω of diameter), then the radius of the full circle is 6. 
- Knowing this, the area of an inner circle is PI*r^2, or in this case PI*1^2. The area of the full circle is PI*6^2. To find the percentage of the inner circle to the outer, we find ourselves with (PI*1)/(PI*36), which simplifies to 1/36, or 2.77%
- When stacking 36 circles, the hexagonal arrangement naturally finds balance with 37 circles (one in the middle). Naturally, this comes as a simple way to establish the CEO role as the 37th circle. With 1/37 = 0.027027027 repeating, to make it simple 2.7% is attributed to each circle, with the remainder added to the CEO's share (2.71%)to serve as a tie breaker in close votes.

(imagine each of the gray circles [Yin] is actually 3 circles stacked on top of each other)

### Corporate Governance Significance
- Yin represents Quarterly accumulated contributions from members of the Circaevum team. This is estimated as points calculated based on the time and rate of influence on Circaevum's growth, which is estimated by the team at the beginning of a quarter when the work is scoped out, and re-evaluated at the end to sure up numbers. 
- Yang represents long-term ownership in the voting rights of the DAO. 
- During a Quarterly review, accumulated Yin contributions can be converted into direct payments (if profits are sufficient), or Yin can be converted into Yang based on the Yin-toYang Conversion Formula

## Growth Progressions
### Outer Core: First 6 team members (CEO is Inner Core)
![Outer Core](./images/circles-core7.png)

Each Outer Core team member can earn up to 5.4% (two Yang tokens), and can be burned at a rate of 0.45% per quarter (0.45% x 6 = 2.7%). In total, their value in the company equals 32.4%. Until the Core is full, each Outer Core member will get 14% of the voting rights, and the Inner Core will get 16% in voting rights to total 100%.

**Round One**
| Member Type    | Count | Voting Power per Member (%) | Total Power (%) |
|----------------|-------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| Inner Core     | 1     | 16%                         | 16%             |
| Outer Core     | 6     | 14%                         | 84%             |
| **Total**      |       |                             | **100%**        |


### Mantle: Next 12 team members
![Mantle](./images/circles-mantle19.png)

Each Mantle team member can earn up to 2.7% (one Yang token). Making a total of 18 active slots, the burn rate now decreases to 0.15% per quarter (0.15% x 18 = 2.7%). In total, the Mantle's value in the company also equals 32.4%. Until the Mantle is full, the Core votes will adjust to 7% (Outer) and 10% (Inner), with Mantle votes amounting to 4% each, so the total remains 100%.

**Round Two**
| Member Type    | Count | Voting Power per Member (%) | Total Power (%) |
|----------------|-------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| Inner Core     | 1     | 10%                         | 10%             |
| Outer Core     | 6     | 7%                          | 42%             |
| Mantle         | 12    | 4%                          | 48%             |
| **Total**      |       |                             | **100%**        |


### Biosphere: Next 18 team members

![Biosphere](./images/circles-orbit.png)

Each Biosphere team member can earn up to 1.8% (two Yin tokens). Making a total of 36 active slots, the burn rate now decreases to 0.075% per quarter (0.075% x 36 = 2.7%). In total, their value in the company also equals 32.4%. In this phase, everyone gets 2.7%, with the Inner Core at 2.71%, again totaling to 100%.

**Round Three**
| Member Type    | Count | Voting Power per Member (%) | Total Power (%) |
|----------------|-------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| Inner Core     | 1     | 2.71%                       | 2.71%           |
| Outer Core     | 6     | 2.7%                        | 16.2%           |
| Mantle         | 12    | 2.7%                        | 32.4%           |
| Biosphere      | 18    | 2.7%                        | 48.6%           |
| **Total**      |       |                             | **100%**        |

### Orbit
Not quite sure how orbit works entirely, but generally serves as a buffer for the company to grow into. It's where new team members can express interest, complete assignments, gain access to the company, and generally grow into the company.

### Dark Matter

This is for the investors. They can wield great power, which we don't fully understand. Not even sure where they show up on the circles. Maybe they are the reason for the nature of the hexagon. 



## Quarterly Development Review Sequence

1. All Revenue enters the Treasury, and payments to Costs for the Quarter are deployed. The remaining Profits will be set aside for Steps 4 and 5
2. The accumulated contributions of the previous Quarter are tallied up
3. Yang token holders vote on the next Quarter's needs, and estimated costs are set aside from Profits (Yin equivalents using Yin-toYang formula are included in vote regardless of Yin consumption decision)
4. 1st half of remaining Profits is set aside for Yin token holders (unless converting to Yang)
5. 2nd half of profits is divided amongst Yang holders on burned 2.7% equivalent, then is voted on for future investments in the company.
6. The YinYang rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise (or 60 maybe?)
    - 60 would allow for 1 full circle to earn 2 Yang tokens, and even rotation mechanics of circles in hexagonal arrangement
7. The Next Quarter begins

### Contributor's Perspective
Every quarter of contributions an individual can be awarded 1 Yin token, which is valued at 0.9% of profit sharing. Upon reaching 3 Yin tokens, the contributor can convert these 3 Yin tokens into 1 Yang token, which is valued at 2.7% of equity and voting rights. So in 3 quarters, a contributor can have 1 Yang token, which is valued at 2.7% of the company. Further, if it's still Round 1 when they reach 3 more Yin tokens, they can convert those additional 3 Yin tokens into 1 additional Yang token, but are then capped at owning 2 Yang tokens. This is to keep the Core team balanced, and to reserve more incentive for the Mantle and Biosphere teams. Mantle members can earn 1 Yang token, and while Biosphere members can only earn 2 tokens, they can barter with eachother for the chance to secure any remaining Yang tokens that haven't been claimed yet. While Yang holders don't earn profit-sharing, they can still earn additional Yin tokens to get paid when the company is profitable.
